#+TITLE: Channeling Guile
#+AUTHOR: Jakub Wojciech

A GNU Guile wrapper for Channeling library.
It works (at least I think it does, because it may be broken after the last Channeling merge) but is pretty basic.

It's not completed yet, still copies message data between C++ world and Scheme world, fortunately one way only.
